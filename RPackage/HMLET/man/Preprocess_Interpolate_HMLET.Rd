\title{Interpolate missing Gaze Points}
\usage{
Preprocess_Interpolate_HMLET(
  data,
  ID = "ID",
  trial,
  timePoint,
  GazeX,
  GazeY,
  maxNAToFill = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{long format dataframe containing temporal data.}

\item{ID}{string for column name that represents IDs within data frame, defaults to "ID".}

\item{trial}{string for column name that identify unique trials within data frame. Can be numerical or categorical.}

\item{timePoint}{string for column name that represents time stamps of each sample.}

\item{GazeX}{string for column name that includes X coordinate of gazepoints}

\item{GazeY}{string for column name that includes Y coordinate of gazepoints}
}
\description{
Gaze Coordinates may have missing values due to blinks, head movement, etc.
This function fill the NA Gaze points with linear interpolation. You can specify
how many consecutive NAs should be interpolated by passing maxNAToFill parameter.
}
\details{
The output is the same dataframe as input with three new columns:
"GazeX_Interpolated": includes all original GazeX coordinates and interpolated values
"GazeY_Interpolated": includes all original GazeY coordinates and interpolated values
"Interpolated": is a flag that is 1 for samples that are interpolated and 0 otherwise.
Note: If your dataframe has columns with same names make sure to rename them before using this function.
