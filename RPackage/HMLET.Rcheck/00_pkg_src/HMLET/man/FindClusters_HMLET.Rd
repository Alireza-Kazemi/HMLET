\item{tValues}{dataframe of t values calculated from ComputeTValues_HMLET.}

\item{threshold_t}{optional probability threshold for statistical comparison, defaults to NA and will be computed based on number of trials when "between trials
permutation" is called or will be computed based on number of subjects when "between subjects permutation" is called.
Alpha = 0.025.}

\value{
t value dataframe with appended cluster information.
